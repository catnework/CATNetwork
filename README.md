# CAT Network Overview


This repo provides a description for setting up a ready-to-use private network that is designed to be easily integrated with any business application 
and Substrate-based blockchain to handle the in-app assets transfers between the application and its users, even facilitating peer-to-peer transfers
users.

This turn-key network intends to abstract the implementation complexity for businesses, 
as well as providing a ready-made package to optimize for a higher level of security, privacy, and performance, 
and to serve as a template or base-implementation of a highly customizable and performant enterprise-specific blockchain network.
It presents a significant step towards easier adoption of blockchain technology for all who are part of the greater Web3 Foundation Substrate ecosystem.


**CAT's Substrate-based private networks will feature:**
* A set of turn-key substrate-based packaging and tools that simplify the customization, configuration, testing, and deployment of such a blockchain network.
* Pre-built solutions to create/assign/transfer derivative assets in business to consumer use cases.
* Pre-configured and optimized for feeless transactions and performance.
* Creation of custom derivative assets and automate the transfer to/from user wallets to app wallets by any/app brand.
* Optimization of batch user onboarding and transaction processing for higher throughput situations needed for consumer apps/sites.

Next to that, CATâ€™s [custodial wallets](https://github.com/catnework/CAT-Identity-Custody-SDK) and Data Clouds (DCs) wil be designed to work in 
conjunction with this Network.

### Who is this repo meant for?

This repo aims to be beneficial to applications & developers who are looking to easily adopt  value adding blockchain technology in a turnkey manner.

How does this technology  benefit application developers?
* By facilitating Identity abstraction. 
* By storing the data for each user in their individual ledger
* By assigning / distributing in-app assets via blockchain technology.
